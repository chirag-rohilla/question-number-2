# question-number-2
I am attempting to write a multithreaded program that calculates various statistical values for a list of numbers. This program will be passed a series of numbers on the command line and will then create three separate worker threads. One thread will determine the average, the second will find the maximum, and the third will find the minimum.  This is my code. It compiles and runs, but crashes with a segmentation fault. I am a beginning programmer. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
